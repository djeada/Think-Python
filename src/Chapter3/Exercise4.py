"""
Exercise 4  
A function object is a value you can assign to a variable
or pass as an argument. For example, do_twice is a function
that takes a function object as an argument and calls it twice:

def do_twice(f):
    f()
    f()

Hereâ€™s an example that uses do_twice to call a function named
print_spam twice.

def print_spam():
    print 'spam'

do_twice(print_spam)

Type this example into a script and test it.
Modify do_twice so that it takes two arguments,
a function object and a value, and calls the function twice,
passing the value as an argument.
Write a more general version of print_spam, called print_twice,
that takes a string as a parameter and prints it twice.
Use the modified version of do_twice to call print_twice twice,
passing 'spam' as an argument.
Define a new function called do_four that takes a function
object and a value and calls the function four times,
passing the value as a parameter. There should be only
two statements in the body of this function, not four.
