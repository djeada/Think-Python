Exercise 5 
The brilliant mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan found an infinite series
that can be used to generate a numerical approximation of pi:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan#Mathematical_achievements

Write a function called estimate_pi that uses this formula to compute and
return an estimate of pi. It should use a while loop to compute terms of
the summation until the last term is smaller than 1e-15 (which is Python
notation for 10^âˆ’15 ). You can check the result by comparing it to math.pi.
You can see my solution at thinkpython.com/code/pi.py.

import math


def estimate_pi():
    k = 0.0
    last_term = 1.0
    sigma = 0
    while last_term > 1e-15:
        last_term = ((math.factorial(4.0 * k)) * (1103.0 + 26390.0 * (k))) / (
            (math.factorial(k) ** 4.0) * (396.0 ** (4.0 * k))
        )
        k += 1.0
        sigma += last_term
    result = ((2 * math.sqrt(2)) / 9801) * sigma
    return 1 / result


print(estimate_pi())
print(math.pi)
